# ùÑû ~~&nbsp;SOUND&nbsp;~~ ùÑû

 A rethinking of the soundcloud UI using HCI methods for IAT351

## ùÑ¢ Project Deliverables:
Report detailing your team design process detailing these three waves:

1. Wave 1: design for human perceptual, cognitive, and motor performance Did the design process take human capabilities and limitations into account? Were established Wave 1 methods used to define human abilities and to confirm that the design was highly usable for its users?

2. Wave 2: design for societal and organizational rules, processes and values Did the design process take rules, ethics, and organizational/social considerations into account. Were established Wave 2 methods used to define the social and organizational contexts in which the design would be used and to confirm that it will integrate in those processes?

3. Wave 3: design for user experience Did the design processes show evidence of advanced design thinking and design craft (e.g. ideation, etc.) for the design of the graphical interface? 15pts Wave 4: Integrative HCI How was information about the usability, context, and UX design integrated in the overall design process? Were tradeoffs identified, and if so, how were they dealt with?
The application or interactive site
Code and images used in implementing the project
Peer review of process and contributions of team members (may used to allocate group marks to individual team members)

## ‚ô≠ Grading Rubric
- Design for human capabilities. Did the design process take human capabilities and limitations into account? Were established Wave 1 methods used to define human abilities and to confirm that the design was highly usable for its users?

- This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Wave 2: design for societal and organizational rules, processes and values. Did the design process take rules, ethics, and organizational/social considerations into account. Were established Wave 2 methods used to define the social and organizational contexts in which the design would be used and to confirm that it will integrate in those processes?

- This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Wave 3: design for user experience. Did the design processes show evidence of advanced design thinking and design craft (e.g. ideation, etc.) for the design of the graphical interface?

- This criterion is linked to a Learning Outcome Wave 4: Integrative HCI. How was information about the usability, context, and UX design integrated in the overall design process? Were tradeoffs identified, and if so, how were they dealt with?
